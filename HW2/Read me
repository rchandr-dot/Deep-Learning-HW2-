How to run the code:
I used palmetto, so i suggest using the same. 
First clone the repo and transfer all the files to palmetto home section
And then also make sure the dataset is present in the home section so that we can use the testing videos.
And make sure the saved model modelkanish.h is in the folder where we have the saved models because it takes 60 mins+ to train a new model.
Now run the sh file using the following command and you will get the bleu score as the output and a text file op will be created 
./hw2_seq2seq.sh
in case it says permission denied or something similar to that 
Please use the following command first before running the sh file 
chmod +x hw2_seq2seq.sh

Also note that depending on where you run the code and how you run it you might have to make changes to argument 1 and argument 2 in the sh file and also make changes to the dataset path and model path in the model_test and model_train python files.
